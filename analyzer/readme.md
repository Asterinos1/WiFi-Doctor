Performance analyzer part here.


parser_all.py -> contains method: annotate_performance() which performs the analysis
                    based on the info extracted by the parser, this method comments
                    on the various stats such PHY Type, Rate gap etc.

pdf_data.py -> contains the data about MCS, SNR and RSSI. 
                and functions to access them based on the MCS index.

perf_analyzer ->    ** THIS IS A DUMMY FILE **
                    removed dummy code, now contains pdf_data.py module and showcases example usage.
