How to use the tool:

1) Place any .pcap file you wish to analyse in the directory /pcap_files.

2) When you run the program, you will be asked to select a parser.
     (parser_home is NOT recommended, it was used for testing, contains bugs)

3) After the program will ask you to select a .pcap file.

4) Wait for the wifi_doctor to extract the info from the .pcap file.

5) Finally, select if you want to do Monitor or Performance Analysis.

After a succesfull run, there will be plots/txt files depicting the reults of the analysis/monitor inside
the root directory for you to analyse further if you wish to, they contain extra comments on the stats obtained by the packets.


** IMPORTANT **
There's a bug that makes the Performance Analysis plots to look strange when rerun or after the Monitor run. In that case restart the tool.


Example of succesfull run:

Select Parser:
1) parser_all
2) parser_for_testing
3) parser_home
4) Exit
Enter your choice: 2
